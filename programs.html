                    <p class="programa">Throughout the session, the background of PPG was introduced by the speaker, and the operational mechanics of Power BI were illustrated through a dessert-making analogy. 
                                        This approach rendered the sharing session highly interactive and accessible. 
                                        It was realized that Power BI functions as an expansive platform rather than just a software application, given its ability to integrate with numerous data sources and its structure across three core components: Desktop, Service, and Mobile.
                                        Furthermore, a significant point addressed by the speaker was the demonstration of appropriate VPN configurations. 
                                        This was emphasized to ensure that data security is maintained and that information is accessed only by the intended personnel.
                                        In conclusion, this talk served as a vital reminder of the importance of continuous learning. 
                                        Although certain academic courses present challenges, it was recognized that consistent efforts must be made to enhance both technical knowledge and communication skills. 
                                        It was understood that the resources provided by UTM must be fully utilized, and every opportunity to upskill must be embraced for future professional development.

                    <p class="programa">This event included topics like quantum computing and quantum communication well as education and the environment that helps new businesses grow. 
                                        From this talk, I knew that Malaysia wants to be a leader in this field of science in the region. 
                                        Prof. Dr. Masahiro Kitagawa from Japan talked about what Japan's doing with quantum science. 
                                        He said it can be used in lots of ways especially when it comes to living things. 
                                        At the same time, Mr. Ling Keok Tong from Singapore also shared his ideas on what Singapore's planning to do with quantum science.
                                        There was also an exhibition booth visit where we can look at the research that is being done and see the technology that is being developed. 
                                        This really helped us to understand them better. 
                                        Overall, this event inspired interest in quantum technology among university students and future collaborations.</p>

                    <p class="programa">After this sharing session, I became more and more interested in PPG industry. PPG has always been one of my ideal internship companies because I found that it has a complete technology system, mature workflow and a clear job skill requirements. In my opinion, I think this field will continue to grow and be in line with the needs of more companies, so learning here will give me a better career development path.</p>
